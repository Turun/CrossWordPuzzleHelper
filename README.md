# CrossWordPuzzleHelper

This is a smally programm lets you find every word that fulfill the requirements. e.g. the length and/or characters in specific places.

If you just want to use the programm and not care about the workings behind it, just download the .jar file and put it somewhere on your computer. In the same directory of your jar file create a simple textfile and name it "DirectoryLocation.txt". In this file you put the path to your dictionary file, probably starting with "C:\User\...". Make sure to include the complete filename with the ".txt" ending. Then simply double clickon the .jar File to start the program.

When you select the "fixed length" checkbox, simply type in the letters you already know. Make sure to replace every letter you are not sure about with an underscore. 


The location of the dictionary has to be specified in a file called "DictionaryLocation.txt". In it you have to put the absolute path of the dictionary file.
