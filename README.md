# CrossWordPuzzleHelper

This is a smally programm with a shitty UI that lets you find every word with a specific length and letters in specific places.

If you just want to use the programm and not care about the workings behind it, just download the .jar file and put it somewhere on your computer. In the same directory of your jar file create a simple textfile and name it "DirectoryLocartion.txt". In this file you put the path to your dictionary file, probably starting with "C:\Users\...". Make sure to include the complete filename with the ".txt" ending. Then simply double clickon the .jar File to start the program.

When you enter the length of the word, the programm will create this number of textboxes. Enter the letter where you know they exist and leave free the boxes where the letter is unknow. Press start and the programm will search a Dictionary for the word that fulfills the request and print it out.

The location of the dictionary has to be specified in a file called "DictionaryLocation.txt". In it you have to put the absolute path of the dictionary file.
