# CrossWordPuzzleHelper

This is a smally programm with a shitty UI that lets you find every word with a specific length and letters in specific places.

When you enter the length of the word, the programm will create this number of textboxes. Enter the letter where you know they exist and leave free the boxes where the letter is unknow. Press start and the programm will search a Dictionary for the word that fulfills the request and print it out.

You will have to change the source code in the class Mech though and add the path to your dictionary (String filename = "<path to your dictionary>").

I am working on a solution to make this easier/not neccssary
